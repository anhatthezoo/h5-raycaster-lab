BLOCK : on the level map, a block represents a cell with a physical property (solid block, door...) and an index to a set of TEXTURE TILES applied on the 4 BLOCK WALLS, and the 2 BLOCK FLATS

BLOCK WALLS : each block has 4 walls (north, east, west and south), each wall can have its own texture tile applied on it.

BLOCK FLATS : each block has 2 flats (ceiling and floor), each flat can have its own texture tile applied on it.

TEXTURE IMAGE : a big image containing all the TEXTURE TILES used by BLOCKS. If the image is a PNG, the alpha channel can be used to create textures with non-rectangular shape, orr windows with semi-transparent areas (like dirty glass panes...).

TEXTURE TILE : a fragment of the TEXTURE IMAGE, all tiles have the same size. They are identified by their rank on the TEXTURE IMAGE from left to right.
There are 2 sorts of TEXTURE TILES : 
 - WALL TEXTURE TILES : each tile can be applied to walls
 - FLAT TEXTURE TILES : each tile can be applied to floor or ceiling.
